# 🎓 University Courses Repository

Welcome to my **University Courses Repository**, a collection of part of a projects, assignments, and learning materials from some of the computer science courses I’ve completed during my time @ [University of Wrocław](https://www.uni.wroc.pl/en/).

Most of the notes or projects might be in Polish (my native language) due to subjects requirements.
